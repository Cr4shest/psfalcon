# PSFalcon Support

PSFalcon is a community-driven, open source project designed to assist administrators in leveraging the power of
CrowdStrike APIs within their organizations. While not a formal CrowdStrike product, PSFalcon is maintained by
CrowdStrike and supported in partnership with the open source community.

## Issue Reporting

Issues may be reported [here](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/psfalcon/issues/new/choose) and are used to track
bugs, documentation and link updates, enhancement requests and security concerns.

### Support Escalation

Generally, we endeavor to provide support for using PSFalcon here within the repository. This expands our online
knowledge base, enables self-help for our community, and reduces the amount of time for you to receive answers.
Depending on the root cause, there is a possibility that an identified issue exceeds the scope of the PSFalcon
SDK and may require additional investigation. A maintainer may ask you to refer you to CrowdStrike technical
support should this occur.

If you are a CrowdStrike customer and you would prefer to have your questions or issues handled directly with
CrowdStrike Support, you are welcome to [contact the CrowdStrike technical support team](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/).

### Questions

Have a question you can't find answered in the [wiki](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/psfalcon/wiki) or [samples](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/psfalcon/tree/main/samples)?

Find out if anyone else in the community is experiencing the same issue on our [discussion board](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/psfalcon/discussions).

Issue reports that do not result in a bug finding, documentation or link update, security alert, or enhancement
request are converted into discussions. Discussions that relate to potential errors, documentation and link
updates, security concerns or enhancement requests will result in the generation of an issue report.
